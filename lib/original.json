It is a piano based album that has a contemporary jazz and classical feel. It presents a strong emotion of passions in finding true love, finding your place in the world, lifting yourself up through tough times, releasing internal problems free to being healing, and personal resolutions.\r\n\r\n\"Revitalized Eyes\" has spurts of jazz like moments but is mainly a compilation of the more avant garde, contemporary and experimental classical style songs written in volume 1 of the series \"Seasons\". It is a 10 song album that takes the listener on an invigorating journey of great emotions.","6":null,"info_pt":null,"7":"http:\/\/www.discogs.com\/Jared-C-Balogh-Chaotic-Life-Fin--Revitalized-Eyes\/release\/3107013","discogs":"http:\/\/www.discogs.com\/Jared-C-Balogh-Chaotic-Life-Fin--Revitalized-Eyes\/release\/3107013","8":"http:\/\/www.clearbits.net\/torrents\/1838-jared-balogh---chaotic-life-fin---revitalized-eyes","clearbits":"http:\/\/www.clearbits.net\/torrents\/1838-jared-balogh---chaotic-life-fin---revitalized-eyes","9":"","jamendo":"","10":"","sonicsquirrel":"","11":"http:\/\/scene.org\/file.php?file=%2Fmusic%2Fgroups%2Fenough_records%2Fenrmp282_jared_balogh_-_chaotic_life_fin___revitalized_eyes.zip&fileinfo","scene_org":"http:\/\/scene.org\/file.php?file=%2Fmusic%2Fgroups%2Fenough_records%2Fenrmp282_jared_balogh_-_chaotic_life_fin___revitalized_eyes.zip&fileinfo","12":"","bandcamp":"","13":"","soundcloud":"","14":"jazz,classical,.us","tags":"jazz,classical,.us"},{"0":"enrmp283","cat":"enrmp283","1":"The Easton Ellises","artist":"The Easton Ellises","2":"Ersatz","album":"Ersatz","3":"2011-09-20","release_date":"2011-09-20","4":"http:\/\/http.de.scene.org\/pub\/music\/groups\/enough_records\/enrmp283_the_easton_ellises_-_ersatz.zip","download":"http:\/\/http.de.scene.org\/pub\/music\/groups\/enough_records\/enrmp283_the_easton_ellises_-_ersatz.zip","5":"New single from Canadian e-rock project <a href=\"http:\/\/theeastonellises.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Easton Ellises<\/a>.
