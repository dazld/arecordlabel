## Rebooted site for enough records

Using browserify and npm.

### installation

To build the site, clone the repo, then:

`npm install && npm run-script build`

It will need to be running on a web server to work, or if you are on some *nix like system, can do this too:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

..to get a server running on localhost:8000

### developing

While developing, can use:

`npm run-script start`

to rebuild any modified files on the fly.
