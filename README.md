## Rebooted site for enough records (in progress)

Site is built using browserify, and is using npm.

To build the site, clone the repo, then:

`npm install && npm run-script build`

It will need to be installed on a web server to work, or if you are on some *nix like system, then this will probably work too:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

..to get a server running on localhost:8000
